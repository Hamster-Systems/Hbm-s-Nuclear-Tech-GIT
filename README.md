# <u>**HBM Nuclear Tech Mod - 1.12.2 Extended Edition**</u>

This is my 1.12.2 custom version of the mod

which is forked from the fork made by [TheOriginalGolem](https://github.com/TheOriginalGolem/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is forked from the port made by [Drillgon200](https://github.com/Drillgon200/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is ported from the original mod made by [HBMTheBobcat](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).


The latest version can be found on [Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hbms-nuclear-tech-mod-extended-edition) or under the [Releases page](https://github.com/Alcatergit/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases).
